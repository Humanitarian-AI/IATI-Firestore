# IATI - Google Firestore Cloud Database
Humanitarian AI community members are exploring setting up and storing a copy of IATI's entire corpus in a Google Cloud **Firestore** database.

### IATI Data on Dropbox

A daily snapshot of all IATI data is stored on Dropbox and IATI updates the corpus every 24 hours. The data is stored in hundreds of individuals folders organized by publishing organizations. Information on accessing the data is located here.

The [Dropbox Extractor](https://github.com/Humanitarian-AI/IATI-Extractor) will systematically extract XML data stored in organization folders and export the data to the Google Cloud Firestore database.
